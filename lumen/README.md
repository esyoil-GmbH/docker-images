## Usage

#### Extending the Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` and add other dependencies that your app requires. [See here]() for addons that you can use if you are planning to have a seperate Dockerfile for development.

```
FROM malitta/lumen

RUN apt-get install -y php7.3-pgsql	

COPY . /var/www/
```

#### Running a container

Run the following command from the root of your application directory 

`docker run -dit -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/var/www --name mywebapp malitta/lumen`

Visit `localhost:8080` from the browser and you should see your application.
